# Manifest Utilities

`typewiz manifest` provides tooling around the JSON manifest generated by audits.

- `typewiz manifest validate <path>` — schema and structural validation. Pass
  `--schema extra_schema.json` to layer on custom rules (requires `jsonschema`).
- `typewiz manifest schema` — print the built-in JSON schema, or `--output` to write it.

Use these commands in CI to guard against malformed artefacts in your pipeline.
Validation no longer upgrades legacy manifests: only `schemaVersion` `"1"` is accepted, and the loader rejects missing fields or coercion attempts. Re-run `typewiz audit` if your stored manifest predates the current schema.
