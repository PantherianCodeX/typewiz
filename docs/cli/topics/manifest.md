# Manifest Utilities

`typewiz manifest` provides tooling around the JSON manifest generated by audits.

- `typewiz manifest validate <path>` — schema and structural validation. Pass
  `--schema extra_schema.json` to layer on custom rules (requires `jsonschema`).
- `typewiz manifest schema` — print the built-in JSON schema, or `--output` to write it.

Use these commands in CI to guard against malformed artefacts in your pipeline.
