# Manifest Utilities

> Alpha-quality 0.1.x — the manifest schema is stabilising around `schemaVersion: "1"` but may gain additive fields in 0.1.x releases.

`ratchetr manifest` provides tooling around the JSON manifest generated by audits.

- `ratchetr manifest validate <path>` — schema and structural validation for manifests with `schemaVersion: "1"`. Pass
  `--schema extra_schema.json` to layer on custom rules (requires `jsonschema`).
- `ratchetr manifest schema` — print the built-in JSON schema; use `--output path.json` to write it, and `--indent 2`
  (default) to control JSON indentation.

Use these commands in CI to guard against malformed artefacts in your pipeline.
Validation no longer upgrades legacy manifests: only `schemaVersion: "1"` is accepted, and the loader rejects missing
fields or coercion attempts. Re-run `ratchetr audit` if your stored manifest predates the current schema.

See `docs/ratchetr.md` for a tour of the manifest structure, and `examples/ratchter/manifest.json` under `examples/`
for a concrete sample produced by `ratchetr audit`.
