# Draft-2 preservation map (backbone extraction)

List the *architectural* items from the draft-2 ADR set that must be preserved (or explicitly superseded by the plan). This is not a restatement of the sources—this is the extraction list and its destinations.

| Item ID | Draft-2 source (ID + anchor) | Backbone type (taxonomy/naming/boundary/object class/invariant) | Preserve posture (`verbatim`/`adapt`) | Destination owner (doc) | Destination anchor | Superseded by plan? (Y/N + ref) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


## Guidance

- Prefer `verbatim` for definitional architecture (taxonomy, naming rules) unless the plan explicitly changes it.
- If `adapt`, record the reason in `carry_forward_matrix.md` and ensure there is no drift.
