# Progress board (roll-up)

This is a high-level roll-up to answer: “Where are we, what’s next, what’s blocked?”

| Phase / Workstream | Target(s) | Current status | Next action | Blockers (Q-IDs) | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Preservation mapping | draft-2 extraction + mapping ledgers | Not started | Populate `draft2_preservation_map.md` | | |
| Ownership enforcement | `owner_index.md` + ADR boundaries | Not started | Confirm canonical owners per plan v19 | | |
| ADR rewrites | ADR-0001..0009 | Not started | Start ADR-0003 (central boundary) | | |
| Reference specs | `docs/reference/*` | Not started | Create minimum set per plan | | |
| CLI contract docs | `docs/cli/*` | Not started | Create flag matrix + parity deltas | | |
| Archival + hygiene | archive + link updates | Not started | Define supersedence pointers | | |
