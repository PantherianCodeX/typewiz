# ADR-0006 Paths Foundation: Path system contract; normalization boundaries; base/project-root anchoring

**Purpose:** Establish the path contract posture and decision boundaries for normalization and anchoring, delegating the full resolution algorithm to the reference spec.
**Status:** Normative (Draft)
**Owned concepts:**

- Path contract posture (policy-cited)
- Normalization and anchoring boundaries (decision-sized)
- Delegation to path resolution reference spec and findings/error code catalogs

**Primary links:** `docs/reference/path_resolution.md`, `docs/reference/findings.md`, `docs/reference/error_codes.md`

## Must not contain

- Windows parsing rules (roadmap-only)
- Selector semantics or link traversal rules
- CLI inventories or parity tables
