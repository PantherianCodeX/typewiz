# ADR archive (immutable)

This folder is the canonical location for **archived** ADR drafts and historical snapshots.

**Immutability rule:** Once a document is placed here, it must not be edited. If a reference needs
correction, fix the link from the active location or add an explanatory note *outside* the archive.

See: `docs/_internal/ADR Rewrite Plan v19.md` (archive immutability rule).
