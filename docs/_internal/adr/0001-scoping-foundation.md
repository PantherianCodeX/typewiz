# ADR-0001 Scoping Foundation: Target selection model; include/exclude selectors; selection-time evaluation

**Purpose:** Define the selection pipeline boundaries and decision ownership for target selection, delegating exhaustive selector behavior to the canonical reference spec.
**Status:** Normative (Draft)
**Owned concepts:**

- Selection pipeline boundary (selection occurs before Planning/Execution)
- Selection-time evaluation framing for selectors (decision-sized only)
- Required delegation to canonical selector and findings specs

**Primary links:** `docs/reference/selector_semantics.md`, `docs/reference/findings.md`, `docs/reference/error_codes.md`

## Must not contain

- Path/base/project-root algorithms
- Link traversal rules
- CLI inventories or parity tables
