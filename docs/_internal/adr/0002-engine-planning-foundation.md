# ADR-0002 Engine Planning Foundation: Engine plan construction, merge, and normalization

**Purpose:** Define the decision boundaries for engine plan construction and normalization, delegating exhaustive equivalence and canonicalization rules to the reference spec.
**Status:** Normative (Draft)
**Owned concepts:**

- Plan shape and merge boundaries (decision-sized)
- Identity invariants (delegated details)
- Delegation to engine planning reference spec and findings/error code catalogs

**Primary links:** `docs/reference/engine_planning.md`, `docs/reference/findings.md`, `docs/reference/error_codes.md`

## Must not contain

- Selector semantics
- Path or link resolution algorithms
- Error code decoding rules
- Artifact persistence or write-gating rules
- CLI inventories or parity tables
