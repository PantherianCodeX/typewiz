# ADR Index (internal)

This is the canonical navigation entrypoint for ADR materials during the rewrite.

- **Active ADR set (target):** `docs/_internal/ADR Rewrite Plan v19.md` defines the authoritative ADR inventory and naming scheme.
- **Archived drafts (inputs):** legacy drafts are preserved for reference and will be moved under `docs/_internal/adr/archive/` when superseded.

**Generated region:** do not hand-edit the table between the `GENERATED` markers.
