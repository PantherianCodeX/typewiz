# Roadmap Register (Deferred / Promotable)

**Purpose:** Keep deferred items visible **without** leaking into normative ADR/spec/CLI docs.

**Rules:**

- Use this only for items that must remain visible but are not ready for normative promotion.
- Each row must specify a **promotion trigger**.

| ID | Item | Source (draft-2/plan/issue) | Target roadmap doc | Promotion trigger | Non-foreclosure constraint | Status | Notes |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | | | | | | | |
