# Terminology map (rename and enforcement)

Record terminology decisions and required migrations. This is the enforcement substrate for repo-wide grep checks and for preventing silent drift.

| TERM ID | Old term / alias | New canonical term | Scope (docs/artifacts/CLI) | Owner (ADR/spec) | Migration rule (one line) | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TERM-0001 |  |  |  |  |  | planned |  |
