# files placed inside the folder you want to customise. Example:
#
#   [active_profiles]
#   pyright = "strict"
#
#   [engines.pyright]
#   plugin_args = ["--warnings"]
#   include = ["."]
#   exclude = ["legacy"]
#
# Overrides merge with the root configuration, letting you tailor scanning rules
# for specific packages without duplicating the global settings.
